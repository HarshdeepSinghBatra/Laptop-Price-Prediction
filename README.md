# Laptop Price Prediction App


The Laptop Price Prediction App is a machine learning application designed for predicting laptop prices based on historical data. This project employs various regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to provide accurate price predictions. The app also includes performance metrics such as R2 Score and Mean Absolute Error for evaluating the models. With a fully responsive front-end design using Streamlit, users can easily interact with the application.


## Features

- **Multiple Regression Algorithms:** The app supports the comparison of several regression algorithms, allowing users to choose the most suitable model for laptop price prediction.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the performance of the models using R2 Score and Mean Absolute Error, providing insights into the accuracy of the price predictions.
- **Responsive Front-end Design:** The Streamlit-based front-end ensures a seamless and responsive user experience, making it easy for users to input data and visualize predictions.
